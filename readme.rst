django-podcast
==============

*django-podcast* is a Django application that allows you to easily publish podcasts that conform to the RSS 2.0 and iTunes RSS podcast specifications.

Django and Python version
=========================

This is tested against django 1.5.1 (the current stable release as of May 2013) and it works perfectly
well. You shouldn't have any problem dropping this into a django project from 1.3 onwards.

The ``views`` are implementing using the class based views so earlier versions will
not work.

UDOX Fork
---------

We've amended this so that the file field is now a ``FilePathField``. This allows
users to upload their podcast using a (S)FTP client instead and pick it from the admin.

An additional ``New Feed Url`` attribute has been added to shows to aid in migration.

Our aim for this was to allow users to carry on uploading the rather large (~100Mb)
files without having to implement something fancy on the admin side for reliably
working with such size uploads.


Installation
============

Add ``podcast`` as a tuple item to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
      ...
      'podcast',
      ...
    )

*The following applies to this fork only!* Add the following two settings::

    PODCAST_UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/var/www/podcasts'  # File system location for your podcasts
    PODCAST_BASE_URL = '/podcasts/media'  # Location they are served from on the web side

Note that ``PODCAST_BASE_URL`` is usually handled by the upstream http server such
as nginx or apache. For development you may want to include a ``static_serve`` view.

Add these lines to your URL configuration, ``urls.py``::

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        (r'^podcasts/', include('podcast.urls')),
    )

Run the Django's ``syncdb`` command.

# Podcasts


Dependencies
============

None. However, consider a thumbnail creation utility, such as `sorl-thumbnail <http://code.google.com/p/sorl-thumbnail/>`_, if you are not in control of creating your podcast show artwork. iTunes suggests show artwork should be a width and height of 600 pixels, but you might want to reduce the size of artwork on your website.

Web site URLs
=============

The default, out-of-the-box Web site URLs should look something like::

    http://www.example.com/podcasts/
    http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/
    http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/title-of-episode/

The ``/podcasts/`` portion of the URL is hard coded into the URL configuration. Beautifully designed default templates are included, so feel free to show off your URLs after saving a show and an episode! Note that the templates were not stress tested in Internet Explorer 6 or 7, but work on Web standards browsers.

FeedBurner and iTunes URLs
==========================

After saving at least one show and one episode, consider submitting your feed URL to `FeedBurner <http://www.feedburner.com>`_ for keeping track of podcast subscriber statistics. Your feed URL should be something like, where ``title-of-show`` is the slug of your show::

    http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/feed/

Remember to check the checkbox for "I'm a podcaster!" Your new FeedBurner URL should be something like::

    http://feeds.feedburner.com/TitleOfShow

You can now return to your website's admin and paste this URL into your Show's FeedBurner textbox. For bonus points, `submit your FeedBurner URL to the iTunes Store <https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/publishPodcast>`_. Your iTunes podcast URL should then be something like::

    http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=000000000

The advantage of submitting your FeedBurner URL to the iTunes Store allows you to track show statistics while also giving users the advantage of using the friendly iTunes interface. Return to the admin again and paste the iTunes show URL into the Show's iTunes URL textbox. Promote either the FeedBurner URL or the iTunes URL using each respective template tag on your website (in the simplest example)::

    {{ show.feedburner }}

    {{ show.itunes }}

Ping iTunes for new content
===========================

The iTunes Store checks new content daily but you might want to make a new episode available immediately in the iTunes Store. Visit your show's ping URL to make that episode available, which would be something like::

    https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/pingPodcast?id=000000000

Alternatively, if you're a savvy developer, you could set up a ``cron`` job to handle this, but note that pinging too often could result in a removal from the iTunes Store.

Yahoo! Media RSS feed submission
================================

Likewise, considering `submitting your podcast to Yahoo! Search <http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/submit>`_, which specifically accepts any kind of regularly published media-based (audio, video, image, document, etc.) RSS 2.0 feed or Media RSS feed.

Your Media RSS feed should be something like::

    http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/media/

Google video sitemaps
=====================

If you're creating a video podcast, you can `submit a video sitemap <http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=34575>`_ to `Google Webmaster Tools <http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/>`_. The video sitemap will help Google index videos in `Google Video <http://video.google.com>`_.

After a successful installation, the video sitemap URL should be something like::

    http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/sitemap.xml

Additionally, you can `add the video sitemap URL <http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=64748>`_ to your robots.txt file::

    Sitemap: http://www.example.com/podcasts/title-of-show/sitemap.xml

Google allows the submission of a media RSS feed instead of the sitemap to Google Webmaster Tools if you prefer.

For the curious, django-podcast is compatible with `enhanced podcasts <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_podcast>`_ and HD podcasts; both depend on the respective file's preparation and not on the feeds.
